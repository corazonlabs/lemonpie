    "- Callbacks, Mixed Precision, etc\n",
    "    - Either upgrade the library to use fastai v2.\n",

    "\n",
    "- More models\n",
    "    - Pick some of the best EHR models out there and implement them.\n",
    "    - **Ideas are welcome**.\n",
    "- More datasets\n",
    "    - eICU and MIMIC3 possibly.\n",
    "    - **Ideas are welcome**.\n",
    "- NLP on clinical notes\n",
    "    - Synthea does not have clinical notes, so this can only be done with other datasets.\n",
