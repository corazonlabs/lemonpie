> An open source deep learning library for Electronic Health Record (EHR) data.


In this initial release of the library ..
- it implements 2 deep learning models (an LSTM and a CNN) based on popular papers 
- that uses synthetic EHR data, created using the open source [Synthea Patient Generator](https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea/wiki)
- to predict 4 conditions that are on the [CDC's list of top chronic diseases](https://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/about/costs/index.htm) that contribute most to healthcare costs

The end goal is to 
- keep adding more model implementations 
- keep adding different publicly available datasets 
- and have a leaderboard to track which models and configurations work best on these datasets

## Install
Installable lib coming soon

## How to use

For now, git clone the repo and run the notebooks .. 

1. Run through the following `Quick Start guides` to get a general idea
    - `Quick Walkthrough`
    - `Running Experiments`
2. Setup Synthea
    - And generate the dataset you like
3. Run experiments

## Roadmap
- **A leader-board to track which models and configurations work best on different publicly available datasets**.


- Callbacks, Mixed Precision, etc
    - Either upgrade the library to use fastai v2.
    - Or as a minimum, build functionality for fastai-style callbacks & [PyTorch AMP](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/amp.html).

- More models
    - Pick some of the best EHR models out there and implement them.
    - **Ideas are welcome**.
- More datasets
    - eICU and MIMIC3 possibly.
    - **Ideas are welcome**.
- NLP on clinical notes
    - Synthea does not have clinical notes, so this can only be done with other datasets.
- Predicting different conditions
    - Again different datasets will allow this - e.g. hospitalization data (length of stay, in-patient mortality), ER data, etc.
- Integraion with Experiment management tools like W&B, Comet, etc,.
